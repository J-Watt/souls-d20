                    <h3>The Frozen Warriors Festival (one shot session)</h3>
                    <p>The city of Olafis sits in an arid land dotted with tall mesas and spires of rock. As a gateway
                        between the desert empire of Erume and the rest of the continent of Archea, Olafis has been an
                        important center of trade and travel. To celebrate this, a warriors festival is thrown where
                        outsiders may test their strength and fighting styles against the best of the city. But now,
                        Olafis stands on the brink of ruin. The frost dragon Acire along with a few thousand soldiers
                        from the north swept through and took the city for themselves. Twisted to be a symbol of
                        oppression, the warriors festival is now a way to get rid of prisoners and those who stand
                        against the invaders. You and your group find yourselves trapped in this torturous colosseum,
                        seeking freedom or even revenge.</p>

                    <h3>Tales of the Tomb Prospectors (short campaign)</h3>
                    <p>East of the kingdom of Yhelcain stands the beautiful city of Alvina. Trapped in perpetual autumn
                        and built into the massive golden leaved trees. Alvina is home to a guild of adventurers tasked
                        with delving deep into the southern ruins of Lethrell, which fell generations ago to unspeakable
                        horrors. The ruins of Lethrell are home to powerful artifacts and magic items, some of which are
                        to powerful to pass up or too dangerous to leave in the hands of others. Take your group of Tomb
                        Prospector initiates and delve into the catacombs and dungeons of the ruins, and either come
                        back rich with a haul of twisted treasures, or be driven mad at what you witness below.</p>

                    <p>For the last decade or so, the great western ocean of Sarda Cen has been off limits to almost all
                        travel. Entire fleets of ships go missing, with not even a single surviving soul to tell the
                        tale of what happened. But amidst the chaos of war with the north, one last ship has been
                        secretly commissioned to embark from the port of the golden capitol of the empire of Erume.
                        Crewed with
                        mercenaries and sailors that are mad enough for the journey, and tasked with discovering any
                        glimpse of hope for reopening the waters or turning the tide of war, the last ship must sail on
                        cursed waters and search for answers. Being part of this ship your group must stick together and
                        brave
                        the anomalous and mind melting journey with only each other, and those aboard that remain sane
                        enough to rely on.</p>
