            <p>Souls D20 started as a fun and chaotic side project between a small group of friends. After playing and
                having fun with it for more than a year we decided to expand the book and add new players. Six years
                later the book has gone through countless patches and multiple massive updates. Now we have the game
                being played and tested by more than ten testers which have played thousands of hours of campaigns.</p>

            <p>The growing Souls D20 team includes passionate contributors dedicated to curating the rulebook, building
                online tools to make play easier, creating incredible artwork, and growing our discord community. We're
                always excited to include new players to the Souls D20 experience so come and ask questions if you are
                looking to learn more! We will happily guide you in how to build characters, learn the rules and get
                playing. </p>
