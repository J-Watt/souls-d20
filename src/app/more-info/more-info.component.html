                    <p>Most abilities are usable with most weapon types! For example, a character that has invested into
                        the Daggers tree to do more damage from behind, will be able to take advantage of that ability
                        even when they are wielding a weapon other than a dagger.

                    <p>Choose from a list of dozens of feats of destiny, which unlike weapon feats, can be invested into
                        at any level by any character. Feats of destiny include the ability to become truly undead and
                        take permanent injuries instead of dying, being able to speak new languages and communicate with
                        any monster, and have a magical familiar which is bound and controlled by you.
